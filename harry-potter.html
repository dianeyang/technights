            <h1>Harry Potter Text Generator</h1>
            <p>At this point, we've seen how Markov chains work, and we've trained an order-1 Markov chain on a small set of text to generate book titles. Even with just 6 input titles, we were able to get a variety of results. But this technique usually works better with more input text. Let's see what happens when we give the computer a lot more words to learn from!</p>
            <p>In this exercise, you'll be experimenting with order-<em>n</em> Markov chains that have been trained on all the text in <em>Harry Potter</em> series of books (that's about <em>1 million</em> words!). But what should the value of <em>n</em> be? That's up to you! Experiment with different values of <em>n</em> and see how that changes your results.

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose a value of <em>n</em> from 1 to 4 in the dropdown below.</li>
                <li>Click "Show starting words" and pick one of the options to start your sentence.</li>
                <li>Take the last <em>n</em> words from your sentence put them in the search box to see what words could come next. Repeat this step until the screen says you've reached the end of the sentence.</li>
                <li>After you reach the end of your sentence, you can go ahead and start another sentence. Remember to try different values of <em>n</em>!</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Note: When you enter text into the search bars, make sure to use the <strong>exact same capitalization and punctuation</strong> as what the computer originally gave you!</p>
